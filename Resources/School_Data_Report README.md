Trends in school performance 

From the given data set, there are two main categories of information to keep in mind: 
Data pertaining to population, and data pertaining to school types. 
At first glanced it seems that the bigger the school budget the lower the test scores tend to be, but at a second glance at the data, you will see that the impact budget has on grades does not make a substantial difference to test scores. A bigger factor is the number of students at a given school and the type of school the students attend.


Breakdown of numbers using averages and percentages based on the school analysis below:

Top Performing schools (by % overall passing ) section, you can see the top five top performing schools and top five bottom performing schools.
The average budget for the top 5 top performing schools is 989,483.60. 0.16% if you divide the student count by the budget 0.16% of the money could go to each student in theory. 
The average budget for the top 5 bottom performing schools is 2,491,815. If you divide the student count by the budget 0.15% of the money could go to each student in theory.
The Average top performing school student count is 1641.2 Much less than the district but much better grades, and the same money as the district schools proportionally.
The Average top performing school student count is 3852.2 Much more than the district but much worse grades, and the same money as the charter schools proportionally.

Based on this logic, the schools spend no more money in relation to the student count.

It may appear that the more money a school spends the worse the grades but based on the numbers a better argument is that the bigger the population of students in each school the worse the grades become. Based on the money to student ratio of both the top 5 bottom and top performing schools the amount of money in the budget to the number of students on average is the same on average. Then why is there such a significant difference in grades if the money is the same relationally to the student count? It comes down to population at each school. You can see clearly that the more students at a given school the worse the grades.

The score by school size section of the analysis shows a drastic negative effect on scores once the student population passes a certain threshold.

Based on the data set,
 0-1000 students at a school have a 89% Overall pass rate
1000-2000 students have a 90% passing rate
And the 2000-5000 students a 58% overall passing rate.

Once student population goes over 2000, the overall passing rate plummets.  In summary to my first point, the higher the student count is, the worse the grades become based on the data given.

The next striking trend and my second point is the effect school type has on grade scores. In the Scores by school type section of the analysis, the charter schools have an overall passing rate of 90%, and the district schools have an overall passing rate of 53%. Charter schools have a 58% higher passing rate than the district schools. This also ties in with the first point about the effects the population has on grades as all the top 5 performing schools are charter school and have 42% less students with relationally the same amount of money as the district schools. Based on this data set, the charter school overwhelmingly have better grades than district schools. Many factors of why charter schools having better scores could be explored but where not in the data set, but two that are consistent is the correlation between school type and grades and the impact a large student population has on grades. This concludes my second point and report.
