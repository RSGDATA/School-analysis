Hello you will find my PyCitySchool analysis in the resources folder. My PyCitySchools analysis is name SchoolDataFrame. 
My report is also in the resources folder and is named School_Data_Report. I apologize, I was not able to put my analysis in the PyCitySchools folder like the instructions
asked. My program wanted everything in the resources folder to run, and do not want to move files to different folders as it will throw errors to my code when ran. 
Jupyter Notebook, the two csv files need to be in the resources folder to run as is.

Thank you.
